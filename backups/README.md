# Backup Directory

This directory contains network backup files generated by the Chord DHT network.

## Backup File Format

Backup files are JSON files containing:
- Network metadata (m parameter, ring size, total nodes)
- Individual node states
- Data distribution across nodes
- Metrics and performance data
- Timestamps

## File Naming Convention

`network_backup_<timestamp>.json`

Where `<timestamp>` is a Unix timestamp indicating when the backup was created.

## Backup Contents

Each backup file contains:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "ISO 8601 timestamp",
  "network_info": {
    "m": "ring size parameter",
    "ring_size": "total ring capacity",
    "total_nodes": "number of active nodes"
  },
  "nodes": [
    {
      "node_id": "unique node identifier",
      "successor_id": "successor node ID",
      "predecessor_id": "predecessor node ID", 
      "data": "encrypted data stored on node",
      "metrics": "performance metrics",
      "load": "current node load"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Usage

Backup files can be used to:
1. Restore network state after failures
2. Analyze network performance over time
3. Debug network issues
4. Study data distribution patterns

## Automatic Cleanup

Old backup files should be cleaned up periodically to save disk space. The application typically retains the most recent backups.
